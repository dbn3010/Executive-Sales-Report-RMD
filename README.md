# Executive-Sales-Report

INTRODUCTION

Retail industry is one among the core industries which involves the process of selling consumable goods to the purchaser and generating revenue out of this process. It involves both online and offline market for the business. In this digital world, as the businesses are growing, so do the data. Several strategies are not being implemented to maximize the output such as market analysis, customer analysis, production and distribution channels reviews etc. Part of data collection, transaction data is very crucial for companies involved in this industry to analyze it and use the gained insights for their benefits in business growth (References: Kimberly, 2020).

Retail data analytics is now a driving force in this industry by collecting and analyzing the sales data to uncover hidden patterns and trends to gain more insights about the performance of specific department, stores, customers and vendors. By performing effective analysis, we can use to insights to improve and optimize pricing, help retaining customer loyalty by addressing their needs timely, by recommending products of their interests based on their purchase history to keep them attracted and also to implement new solutions where existing process is lacking.(Referenced from Ron, 2019 and Alexandra, 2021)

As a sales analyst, I will be analyzing the available data set Project6Data.xlsx which lists the details about the global sales history of consumer, corporate and home office products for the year 2020. This data contains categorical variables such as product names, its department and division, global market and regions etc. It also incorporates numerical variables as total sales, product price, discount, losses, profits etc. This data set holds 1000 sales records corresponding to 27 variables.

Through the available data set, we would be trying to look through the major loss and profit points in across multiple divisions. For this, we will be using R to analyze the data set and plot the figures accordingly to summarize our study.
